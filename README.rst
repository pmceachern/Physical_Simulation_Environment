TIP GN Model - Gaussian Noise Model for optical feasibility simulation
======================================================================

This Model is coded as a joint effort in the OOPT-PSE Working Group of TIP.

----

TIP provides a reference implementation of the Gaussian Noise Model based on
Work performed at the `Politecnico di Torino <https://www.optcom.polito.it/talks>`_.
This reference implementation is intended to be used as a baseline for optical simulations in TIP. Providing a benchmark for alternative simulation methods.
A read-out to the working group was provided on `2017-05-11 <https://workspace.telecominfraproject.com/higherlogic/ws/groups/open_optical/download/183>`_.
