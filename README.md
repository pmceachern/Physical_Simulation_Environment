# TIP_GNmodel
Gaussian Noise Model for optical feasibility simulation

This Model is coded as a joint effort in the OOPT-PSE Working Group of TIP. It provides a reference implementation of the Gaussian Noise Model based on Work performed at the University of Torino: https://www.optcom.polito.it/talks
This reference implementation is intended to be used as a baseline for optical simulations in TIP allowing to benchmark alternative simulation methods.
A read-out to the working group has been provided 2017-05-11 https://workspace.telecominfraproject.com/higherlogic/ws/groups/open_optical/download/183

BSD 3-Clause License has been chosen to allow broad industry adoption of this code.
